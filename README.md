## 🎵 How It Works

The application uses the Web Audio API to procedurally generate music based on carefully crafted presets. Each preset defines:

- **Musical Characteristics**: Tempo, instruments, atmosphere, and key elements
- **Mood**: Emotional qualities that shape the composition
- **Audio Parameters**: Synthesis settings that recreate the sonic signature of each source material

When you select a preset and click "Generate Music", the application:
1. Analyzes the preset's musical characteristics
2. Creates oscillators, filters, and effects chains
3. Synthesizes audio in real-time
4. Plays the generated composition through your speakers

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Browse the preset cards and select your favorite film or series
3. Click "Generate Music" to create your soundscape
4. Use the playback controls to pause, resume, or regenerate
5. Adjust the volume slider to your preference
